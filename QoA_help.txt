Program: Quest of the Ages (a.K.a. QoA) is a text based RPG (role 
playing game). You start off sleeping in your bed dreaming about a
character. You have the choice of one of three possible characters:
a Warrior, a Tank & a Court Jester, each with their own stats:
Health, Attack & Luck. Once you have chosen your character, you will
enter the world where your kingdom is under attack by the dragon:
Ridley! To get to Ridley you have to adventure through various 
stages, fighting enemies, leveling up & acquiring loot. For every 
stage within Quest of the Ages, you are given the option to choose
you path. Each path has a event that'll occur such as finding loot
or encountering enemies. If you happen to come across anything than
an enemy, you can be rewarded with loot or take damage from a trap or 
a blank path with nothing special. But, if a battle does commence the 
fighting sequence occurs. Within this fighting sequence you have the 
option to fight the enemy or take your chances to avoid the enemy.
Avoiding is based on luck, therefore avoiding differes based on the 
character you select. Fighting however is the same amoungst all 
characters. Your characters attack & health stats are accounted for
& are used against the enemys attack & health stat. However, Quest
of the Ages isnt a turn based game, more a luck based RPG. A random
number is generated between 1 to 10. There is a range for the numbers
that each result in a action. Example: if the random generated number
is a 2, you will inflict damage on the enemy. If the random generated
number is a 9, the enemy will inflict damage on you. If your health is 
lowered to or below 0, you are dead & the game is over. If you manage
to bring the enemy's health to 0, you earn gold & progress through
the adventure. Eventually you will come across a boss battle. Boss
battles work the same as normal battles however you are more rewarded.
Not only you gain more gold, but you gain a level. Increasing your
character's level means your attack & health stat increase drastically. 
Once the boss for the stage is defeated, you will enter a shop 
which the owner will firstly, restore your health then offer you items
used to help you throughout your adventure, with the cost of gold.
This process is repeated throughout all the stages until the final
boss, Once Ridley, is defeated, then the kingdom gets saved or die 
at any point in time, the game will end & ask you Would you like to 
play again?" If you type yes the game starts fresh from the beginning. 
Or if you type no or anything else the program will end. Now you're 
ready to enter the world of Quest of the Ages.
